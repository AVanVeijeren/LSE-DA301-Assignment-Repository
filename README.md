This repository contains my LSE Advanced Analytics for Organisational Impact assignment. 

We were tasked with using advanced anlytical methods in both Python and R to provide fictional company Turtle Games with insights that will improve overall sales performance. 


Assignment Week One Insights: 

Questions for next time:
- must outliers be removed? 
- must a cleaning of the data be conducted as in assignment one? 
- could renumeration and spending score be used in a multiple linear regression to more accurately explain how loyalty points are accumulated? 
       
Summary: 
- Age cannot be used to explain loyalty points. 
- Renumeration and spending score are averagly good at predicting spending score. Both of their model's F-tests indicate that there is a significant relationship between these variables and how customers accumulate loyalty points.
